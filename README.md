# Undergraduate Thesis
## Joint Source-Channel Encoding for Image Transmission over Wireless Networks

Implementation of our undergraduate thesis. EncoderFactory will create an encoder/decoder pair that train it against the channel provided. Each Encoder will map a single Channel-Optimzed Scalar Quantizer (COSQ) an element of the image DCT. COSQs will be allocated more bits depending on the important of that DCT coefficient, as specified by the bit allocation matrix.
